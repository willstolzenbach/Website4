<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;">About me</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I am 15 years old and I am a sophmore at Medfield Highschool. I have lived in Medfield for almost my entire life. In school, I enjoy working with computers including coding and editing videos.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #0000ff;">Academics And extracurricular activities</span></h3>

<h5><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hope for Haiti</span></h5>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>As a Freshman I was a part of the Hope for Haiti club where we thought of ways to raise money for poeple in poverty. The club would meet once a week after school and we raised money by making food and other activities. We also spread awareness about current problems all over the world.</li>

<h4><span style="color: #3366ff;">Athletics</span></h4>
<p>I play Medfield varsity football and varsity baseball. Football teachers you how to be a part of the team and it teaches extreme ownership. I have been playing both sports for a long time.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;">Jobs</span></h3>
<p>I have worked at Sluggers Acedemy in Medfield for about 3 months. Part of my job at Sluggers is to clean the tunnles and orginize the lobby area. Sometimes I have to close and turn off all the lights and fans and lock the doors. Another part of my job is that I have to use a &nbsp;complicated computer system. The system allows us to book tunnels for sports teams and then use the computer system to charge them for it.</p>
